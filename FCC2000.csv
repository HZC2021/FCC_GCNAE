"The FCC needs to stand up for Internet users like me and keep the net neutrality rules that are already in effect. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T free rein to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the vital access and privacy safeguards we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations mean that ISPs can't block or slow users' ability to see certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach customers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

My legs and back are very bad, meaning I can't go outside as much as I would like to. I work from home and use the internet in my daily life. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me."
"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

"FCC:  I'd like to share my thoughts on net neutrality and Title II. I want to encourage the Federal Communications Commission to rescind Tom Wheeler's policy to regulate the Internet. Individual citizens, as opposed to Washington, deserve to buy whatever products we choose. Tom Wheeler's policy to regulate the Internet is a exploitation  of the open Internet. It broke a pro-consumer approach that performed fabulously successfully for decades with nearly universal approval."
"To whom it may concern:  In reference to the FCC regulations on the Internet. I'd like to suggest the Federal Communications Commission to undo President Obama's policy to take over broadband. Individuals, not the FCC, should be empowered to purchase whatever products they desire. President Obama's policy to take over broadband is a corruption of net neutrality. It ended a free-market policy that performed supremely successfully for many years with both parties' support."
"I'm contacting you about Title 2 and net neutrality. I want to ask the commission to rescind President Obama's policy to take over broadband. Americans, rather than big government, should be empowered to enjoy whatever services we prefer. President Obama's policy to take over broadband is a corruption of the open Internet. It broke a pro-consumer approach that performed remarkably well for two decades with bipartisan support."
"FCC:  I am a voter worried about internet regulations. I want to urge the Federal Communications Commission to undo Tom Wheeler's order to take over Internet access.

"The FCC should safeguard Internet freedom by keeping the bright-line net neutrality protections in place and upholding Title II. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the legal cover to throttle whatever they please, stripping users of the necessary access and privacy rules we worked for and so recently won.

Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block Internet users' access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I use it everyday. I need it to remain free and open. Too many underprivileged individuals NEED to access it for job searches and the like.  Free and open to ALL. 

I appreciate you maintaining Title II net neutrality rules and the rights of Internet users like me."

The internet is one of the most useful ways in relieving myself of stress. It helps me relax after a day of difficulty. It also enables me the ability to acquire knowledge in quick and easy ways. Without the internet, I would be ignorant and lost in life.

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

"The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T free rein to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the vital privacy and access protections we demanded and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can't block or slow Internet users' ability to see certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That's the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 

The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

Please leave the existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.

Thank you! 

I appreciate you maintaining Title II net neutrality rules and the rights of Internet users like me."

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the vital access and privacy safeguards we fought for and so recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules mean that ISPs can't block or slow users' ability to see certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging online services and websites more money to reach customers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I use the internet to be able to access sites like Twitter, Youtube, Steam, etc. to be able to connect and speak with my friends, if I no longer have net neutrality protecting me I may not be able to have full access or a full speed connection to these websites, making it harder to speak with my friends and meet new people. I also use the internet as my main source of content consumption on websites such as Hulu, Netflix, Crunchyroll, and again if I do not have net neutrality to protect me I may not be able to watch certain shows, consume my favorite content or even be able to access some of my favorite content sites all together.

"Dear FCC,

The FCC must protect the open Internet by maintaining net neutrality protections under Title II. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping users of the vital privacy and access protections we demanded and so recently won. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs will have too much power to determine what I can do online.

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,

"The FCC should safeguard Internet freedom by keeping the bright-line net neutrality protections in place and upholding Title II. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to hand the telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the necessary privacy and access protections we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can't block or slow users' access to certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach people faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The Internet is a uniquely important space for free speech because the Internet is the same for every socioeconomic group. Current law protects this equality. The proposed change to this law would allow corporations to charge certain sites for faster loading speeds, among other things. This would mean the swift destruction of the equality and free access to information you currently enjoy. Do not take this for granted. Protect freedom of speech. Protect a form of media that brings people together. Protect the sharing of knowledge across all kinds of barriers. We are lucky enough to literally hold in the palms of our hands the kind of power people used to merely dream about. Right now that power is threatened, and we are the only people who can defend it. Make sure the Internet remains a place every voice is heard. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block customers' access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach consumers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposal would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

It's everything to every one now.  It's some peoples life line to world and to others it's just a way to stay to stay in-touch with family or friends. While to others it's nothing more than the ""new way"" to send ""mail"" or entertain themselves. And no one people, company, etc should be allowed to tell you where you can go, how ""fast"" you can travel to get there, or how much ""bandwidth"" you allowed. This is the internet not a street, highway or other ""real world"" thing we want or need to relate it too. It's all just 1's and 0's being pushed through copper, glass, plastic, etc. 

Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing Title II net neutrality rules."

People like me, not Washington, should be empowered to use whichever applications we desire. President Obama's scheme to control broadband is a distortion of net neutrality. It undid a light-touch approach that functioned exceptionally successfully for decades with bipartisan approval."
"Dear Mr. Pai,  My comments re: NET NEUTRALITY. I'd like to recommend the government to repeal Tom Wheeler's scheme to take over Internet access.

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

"I am NOT in support of reclassifying broadband Internet access as an information service under Title I. In my opinion it is properly classified as a telecommunication service under Title II.

The FCC should be protecting the consumer not the worrying about dampening ""providers' incentive to invest and innovate"". Providers, will innovate and invest if the consumer demand is there to do it. They will most certainly charge the consumer more if they do. That is their incentive. They do not need the FCC to ""help"" them. The FCC has said that ""reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service has led to significant regulatory burdens"" on providers. These requirements, if they are indeed burdens, are designed to protect people like me who do not want the internet service they receive to be throttled or manipulated in any way by providers that do not have the consumers best interests in mind. You, the FCC, should have the consumer's best interests in mind and not weaken regulations that protect the us. Providers will adjust, jobs will not be lost, and consumers will buy the services they want. The system is not ""broken"" for consumers and you do not have to ""fix"" it.

Thank you for the opportunity to make comments.

The internet is now a sort of neural network, or better a commons, the commons, for how the world communicates with one another. Taking steps that allow for more consolidation of power in this vital infrastructure is shortsighted. For profit telecommunications companies have profit at top of mind, and therefore cannot be given authority to organize the internet how they prefer it to be.

That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

"The FCC must protect the open Internet by maintaining net neutrality protections under Title II. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping consumers of the meaningful access and privacy safeguards we fought for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block users' ability to see certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging online services and websites money to reach consumers faster. That's the best way forward to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

As a young person, the internet has become integral to my life and the lives of those around me as well as development. To monetize that and make it something for the wealthy limits mobility for others and is frankly insulting to the ideals I hold as an American. 

I appreciate you maintaining Title II net neutrality rules and the rights of Internet users like me."
"To the Federal Communications Commission:  My comments re: NET NEUTRALITY. I want to implore the FCC to rescind Barack Obama's order to control the Internet. Individual Americans, as opposed to Washington bureaucrats, deserve to purchase which applications we prefer. Barack Obama's order to control the Internet is a corruption of the open Internet. It reversed a pro-consumer policy that functioned fabulously smoothly for many years with nearly universal consensus."
"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast free rein to throttle whatever they please, stripping Internet users of the vital access and privacy protections we demanded and so recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can't slow or block users' ability to see certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach consumers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

It's currently the most effective means to facilitate communication in the most expedient manner!! 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me."
"Dear Chairman Pai,  Hi, I'd like to comment on restoring Internet freedom. I'd like to encourage the commissioners to repeal Obama's decision to regulate the Internet. People like me, as opposed to Washington, ought to buy which products we choose. Obama's decision to regulate the Internet is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It broke a free-market system that worked remarkably successfully for a long time with nearly universal backing."
"To the FCC:  I'd like to share my thoughts on the Open Internet order. I'd like to demand you to reverse Tom Wheeler's plan to control broadband. Internet users, rather than the FCC, should be able to select whichever services they choose. Tom Wheeler's plan to control broadband is a exploitation  of the open Internet. It undid a market-based policy that functioned remarkably successfully for decades with broad bipartisan backing."
"Dear FCC,  I want to give my opinion on network neutrality regulations. I'd like to encourage the FCC to reverse Barack Obama's plan to control broadband. Citizens, rather than Washington, ought to buy whichever products we want. Barack Obama's plan to control broadband is a betrayal of net neutrality. It reversed a free-market framework that performed exceptionally successfully for many years with Republican and Democrat approval."
"To the Federal Communications Commission:  I'd like to share my thoughts on Internet freedom. I want to recommend the government to overturn President Obama's order to control broadband. Citizens, not Washington, should use the applications we prefer. President Obama's order to control broadband is a betrayal of the open Internet. It reversed a hands-off system that functioned supremely smoothly for two decades with nearly universal approval."
"Dear Mr. Pai,  I'm a voter worried about the FCC regulations on the Internet. I would like to encourage the Federal Communications Commission to undo President Obama's policy to take over broadband. Individuals, rather than the FCC, ought to enjoy whatever services we want. President Obama's policy to take over broadband is a betrayal of the open Internet. It broke a market-based framework that worked fabulously successfully for two decades with nearly universal backing."
"Dear FCC,  I would like to comment on Internet regulation. I'd like to recommend Ajit Pai to reverse Barack Obama's decision to regulate the Internet. Internet users, as opposed to unelected bureaucrats, should be free to purchase which services they prefer. Barack Obama's decision to regulate the Internet is a perversion of net neutrality. It stopped a hands-off framework that functioned fabulously successfully for decades with both parties' backing."
"Dear Chairman Pai,  I have concerns about internet regulations. I strongly advocate the commissioners to rescind The previous administration's plan to control Internet access. Individuals, not the FCC, ought to use whichever products they desire. The previous administration's plan to control Internet access is a distortion of the open Internet. It broke a market-based framework that worked remarkably successfully for decades with bipartisan consensus."
"The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the authority to engage in data discrimination, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and access rules we demanded and just recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block Internet users' ability to see certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services money to reach people faster.

Pai's proposal would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.
The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.
Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.
Thank you! 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

In recent months, I have become increasingly concerned over the direction in which the Federal government is moving (with respect to individuals' rights to online privacy), and over the increasingly obvious bias towards the interests of large corporations over those of the American people.

It was a hard enough pill to swallow when I learned that my own government was secretly surveilling MILLIONS of Americans without a warrant, and that it was essentially unapologetic about doing so.  Now, however, I see my rights being given away openly on the floor of the House of Representative and of the Senate -- with respect to Senate Joint Resolution 34 (H. Res. 230).  This action, by these two governmental bodies, seems a direct result of the Citizens United ruling (visa vi, the present absurdity of campaign financing) -- 

Furthermore, this Commission's current attempts to undermine and destroy the legitimacy of this lawfully upheld regulation, commonly known as Net Neutrality, seems to be yet another grotesque product of that same reprehensible Supreme Court decision.

You should be ashamed of yourselves for even considering to put the desires of these cannibalistic and morally vacuous corporations before the needs of the American people.  SHAME!  SHAME ON YOU!

I hope that you take a very long minute to consider the ramifications of your actions.  Play out all of the possible roads your decision could lead down.  Are some of them dark and scary, with spider webs crossing the path, leaving you reaching for and swatting at nothing, scraping at your face in fear?  That road is a real possibility.  

If you decide to alter this regulation, the future is not assured of sunshine and roses.  Far from it, in fact.  Dismantling the heart of this regulation puts unprecedented power into the hands of a very limited number of individuals.  Modern society functions entirely around digital content, and as our recent elections have shown, that content can be manipulated to produce unanticipated results -- without the consumer even being aware.  No, sirs and madams, do not go down that road, for it leads only to certain and unambiguous peril.   

Every day -- every day -- I wake up feeling like Winston Smith in George Orwell's novel 1984.  I want so badly to be happy, but all I see is unmitigated abuse of power, and I am told that I have to accept it -- that there is nothing to be done.  What always strikes me about that book, is that in the end -- after he has been brain-washed -- he cries.  He cries because he is happy.  He cries because he knows he has lost his own voice, and that he has been coerced into accepting a charade as reality.

Well I will not accept this.  DO NOT ALTER THIS REGULATION!  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IN ANY MANNER. 

 This thing, this wonderful thing called the Internet, is yet still in its infancy and has barely learned to walk.  Yet, like some medieval Feudal warlord you walk in and claim rights to it, as though you had anything to do with it?  You wish to bind its feet and prostitute it? IT IS NOT YOURS.  It never has been, and it never will be.  It belongs to the People.  BE ASHAMED.

"Dear FCC,  My comments re: the FCC's Open Internet order. I would like to demand Chairman Pai to rescind President Obama's policy to take over broadband. Citizens, rather than unelected bureaucrats, should be free to buy the services they prefer. President Obama's policy to take over broadband is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It undid a light-touch system that functioned very successfully for decades with bipartisan support."
"Dear FCC:

The net neutrality act, or title II as it stands is the only way that your group is able to properly protect our rights to equal internet usage, and thus to our rights to equal information. Without this bill, we have no power of choice. Competition in the markets will be determined by who can preemptively slow the other's speeds. This will quickly cause the business fields that rely on internet to be put into jeopardy which will ruin a peice of the fair market that is important to both individual growth and to the growth of our nation. The cost of my goods, and their availability should not be determined because one group hindered the other's ability to reach my modum. 

Removing the effects of Title II has the potential to create huge power vacuums in politics, and would almost certainly hinder my right to learn freely and gain an opinion on a matter that concerns me. How can i go to the polls and express my right as an American citizen without knowing what im voting for or what the bills true ramifications might be? This is a question we already ask ourselves each year, and every four years. The reason we can be confident in our vote however, is because we can learn freely, and know that the truth is there to be found, all we need is time and with net neutrality we can find what we're looking for. 

The removal of Title II would cripple me, and the entire american public of one of our most valuable tools. This would allow false news to grow to an unprecedented degree, and in turn, we'd lack any way to find the truth, or to fight againdt their lies. All because they paid for us to not be able to view those paged that hold the information we're looking for. We would lose our most valuable necessity for survival in a world where knowledge is power. 

The removsl of Title II will leave our upcoming generation in a state where they lack the right to freely learn, to freely express themslves, and to truly be a genuine self. All because they won't have the ability to reach these sites, these hubs of knowledge, culture, expression, media, and community. All they'll have is what the highest bidder finds acceptable. For me, thats easily our greatest loss here. 

Thank you for taking time to hear a young adult's concerns. 

Sincerely, 


Nicole Bracy"

"We need the FCC to defend the rights of millions of Internet users by upholding net neutrality protections. Please reject arguments that prioritize the business interests of an ISP over my right to communicate and assemble online. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast free rein to throttle whatever they please, stripping consumers of the vital privacy and access rules we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block users' ability to see certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That's the best way forward to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform Internet providers into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built.

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

I and other people of sound mind, appropriate age of voting and legal, tax paying citizens, who pay your and your authority's salary support the existing Net Neutrality rules, which classify internet service providers under the Title II provision of the Telecommunications Act. Please DO NOT roll back these regulations, as one knows too well will only hinder give the ISP companies the right to change the current standards and hinder competition.
Again, please DO NOT ROLL BACK TITLE II CLASSIFICATION FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS!!

Thank you,

"The FCC should ensure a fair and open Internet for all by opposing efforts to undermine net neutrality. I stand with the millions of other Internet users who've urged the Commission to keep important net neutrality protections intact. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the necessary access and privacy rules we fought for and won just two years ago. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules mean that ISP monopolies can't block or slow consumers' access to certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services money to reach customers faster.

Getting rid of net neutrality feels like an infringement of our first amendment rights. I don't want my entertainment and other things I do online to be dictated by big companies. I can't stress how important the internet is to me, in its current form. It's a source of knowledge, entertainment, and a great way to socialize for an introvert like myself. I get my news online. Find new friends online in Meetup groups. I participate in fandoms online. Better myself online by studying meditation and philosophy. Keep in touch with old friends and family on social media.  I'm afraid for our freedom of speech. 

Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing Title II net neutrality rules."

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it. 
The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,

"To the Federal Communications Commission:  Hi, I'd like to comment on net neutrality. I would like to implore Chairman Pai to reverse Obama's plan to regulate broadband. Citizens, as opposed to Washington, should purchase whatever products we prefer. Obama's plan to regulate broadband is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It undid a pro-consumer framework that worked very, very successfully for many years with broad bipartisan backing."
"Dear Chairman Pai,  I am concerned about the FCC's Open Internet order. I would like to recommend Chairman Pai to reverse Barack Obama's scheme to take over Internet access. Americans, as opposed to Washington bureaucrats, should use whatever applications they want. Barack Obama's scheme to take over Internet access is a corruption of net neutrality. It reversed a market-based framework that performed remarkably successfully for two decades with broad bipartisan support."

It broke a hands-off framework that functioned very, very well for decades with broad bipartisan backing."
"Service providers should be required to treat all online traffic equally. Net neutrality is important for researchers, students, and others who need access to scientifically/historically accurate information because it gives them greater ability to analyze the available sources, rather than having access only to the information that comes from the source most willing to pay the provider. Doing away with net neutrality also impacts small and/or local businesses, who are less likely to be able to afford to compete with the web-access budgets of larger firms and are therefore less likely to become known to the general public."
"To whom it may concern:  I'm very concerned about net neutrality rules. I'd like to ask the commissioners to reverse Obama's decision to take over the web.

"Please preserve net neutrality and Title II.  No less a fundamental American right as ""equal access for all"" is at stake, and while future generations may well view the present-day administration with horrified disbelief, the retention of Title II would be some proof to our descendants that the 2018 United States government was not wholly in the grip of self-serving plutocrats intellectually incapable of seeing net neutrality for the civil rights issue it truly is. Please do not allow this latest step toward a fascist dictatorship to become a reality; instead, make the US once again a positive example, rather than the cautionary tale it appears to be at present."

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the vital access and privacy rules we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules mean that ISP monopolies can't block or slow our ability to see certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

The internet plays a huge role not only in my personal life, but in my professional life as well. Part of my current job involves using the internet for researching Union Army soldiers, researching through websites such as Ancestry and FamilySearch, and putting that information in a database. Additionally, I also have used the internet for staying in touch with friends, doing assignments for classes, and entertainment as well. If the current net neutrality rules were to be removed, my job could be made more difficult to do, as there is a chance we would need to use more of our budget (which comes from a grant) towards our office internet. The internet has become a public utility for all of us, and needs to start being treated as such. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me."

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and access safeguards we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block consumers' access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services money to reach consumers faster. That's the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

My name is Joey, and I am a freshman in high school. Contrary to expectation, I do not care about the Internet simply for its superficial value. To me, the Internet means much more than a way to find entertainment or chat with friends. To me, the Internet means much more than a way to do homework or contact teachers. To me, the Internet means much more than a way to purchase products or download apps. 

The Internet means knowledge. Innovation. Expression. Freedom. Because of its far-reaching importance in today's modern society, the Internet is vital to democracy. And thus, it is immensely critical that our Internet remains free and open for everyone.

First, Net Neutrality is not the unmerited regulation that some make it out to be. Net Neutrality protects the interests of the People over the special interests of corporations. Allowing Internet service providers and cellular carriers to intentionally prioritize some traffic is simply anti-competitive and unfair. For example, in 2012, AT&T announced a plan to disable Apple FaceTime on iPhones except for customers who subscribed to one of AT&T's more expensive plans (goo.gl/C466V1).  In 2011, MetroPCS tried to block all video streaming on its cellular network, but gave exception to YouTube (goo.gl/SRgtGC).  Another instance in 2005 involved Comcast blocking BitTorrent and other P2P networks for their customers (goo.gl/jkFBSA). The list goes on. But one thing is clear: violations of Net Neutrality unfairly reduce content options for consumers, who would be forced to see what their ISP wants them to see. Net Neutrality protections prevent ISPs from charging servers a fee to remove speed throttling or to boost speeds above everyone else. Although consumers would not be blocked outright from accessing those servers under such an arrangement, small businesses and startups who cannot afford to pay extra to reach customers will be clearly disadvantaged. 

2005 saw Telus blocking customers' access to pro-union websites during a workers' strike against Telus (goo.gl/77tezN). This took place in Canada, not the US, to be clear, but it raises clear concerns about censorship. We already know from history that the Internet has a widespread, profound impact on the world. It has the power to change the world by toppling a government run amok. In 2011, Wael Ghonim used social media to unite the voice of the Egyptian people, leading to a revolution that brought down the incumbent government. For a period of time before President Hosni Mubarak resigned, however, the government ordered ISPs to shut down network routes in and out of Egypt. This effectively cut off Internet access to the Egyptian people (goo.gl/08rS5J). They understood the power of the Internet as a medium of expression and that keeping people in darkness keeps them in oppression. 

In a democratic republic, the people can only vote their conscience if they are informed. As the banner above the Washington Post loudly declares, ""Democracy dies in darkness."" Indeed, this is true. If you take away access to information, you take away control from the people. The Internet keeps citizens aware so that they can make informed decisions about their nation's leaders. When knowledge is power, how can the people rule if that power is denied them? The Internet is also a platform for free speech, giving a voice to the voiceless. It allows people to share their stories, struggles, and subjugation. For this very reason, the United Nations condemns the disruption of internet access as a human rights violation because the Internet is a vital tool, enabling the freedom of expression (goo.gl/89iXum). Finally, the Internet brings to light the actions of the government. It empowers transparency, keeping public servants accountable to the nation.

It is unlikely that ISPs in the US will be able to shut down the Internet entirely as they did in Egypt. Nevertheless, giving them the power to slow down or block servers containing competing content or politically sensitive information is very dangerous. In a world swirling with disinformation, propaganda, and even honest mistakes, it is imperative that all people are able to verify the information they hear and seek out the truth. Especially considering the fact that most customers have few, if any choices of ISPs, I do not believe that it would be an overstatement to say that giving ISPs the power to restrict customers' access to information would be an outright threat to democracy. 

In Section 4 of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Chairman Pai seeks comment on the need for specific parts of the nondiscrimination requirement. However, keeping the ""bright line rules"" (which prohibit blocking, throttling and paid prioritization), does nothing if the very foundation of Net Neutrality is crumbled. If the Internet is reclassified as an information service, the FCC will have no legal authority to actually enforce any bright line rules it chooses to keep (goo.gl/Rqqnee). Thus, I firmly believe that for the Internet to be truly free and open, it cannot be reclassified from a fair and equal telecommunications service to a curated and hand-selected information service. 

I stand for Net Neutrality protections, maintaining ISPs and cellular carriers' classification as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. Because the Internet belongs to all of us. Because America means ""We the People,"" not ""They the Big Corporations."" Because it's the right thing to do. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

If I had access to only 20 websites as opposed to 200,000 websites, I think it would not only limit myself and my freedom to express myself, but it would hinder countless others from having access to express themselves as creators, and restrict them from being involved in other activities like online shopping, social interaction, and creating content. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me."
"Dear Mr. Pai,  I'm contacting you about Internet regulation and net neutrality. I'd like to urge the commission to rescind Obama's scheme to take over Internet access. People like me, rather than so-called experts, should be free to use which services we desire. Obama's scheme to take over Internet access is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It ended a free-market system that functioned very successfully for decades with both parties' approval."
"FCC:  I'm a voter worried about net neutrality and Title II. I want to implore Chairman Pai to overturn The previous administration's scheme to control Internet access. Individual citizens, not Washington, should use whichever products they desire. The previous administration's scheme to control Internet access is a corruption of net neutrality. It ended a market-based system that worked very, very successfully for decades with broad bipartisan consensus."
"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,
Joel C Pressley"

It stopped a market-based policy that performed very, very well for decades with Republican and Democrat support."
"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. Please listen to the millions of Internet users who rely on a free and open Internet, and not just the handful of large ISPs who stand to gain from rolling back net neutrality protections. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy safeguards we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that ISP monopolies can't block or slow our access to certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That's the best way forward to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

The internet matters not just to me but to almost everyone. It is a gateway for people to learn, discover, and even just for entertainment. If you just sellout, not only are you taking away the freedom of the people but also hurt companies and businesses by faving some more than others. So in favor of everyone, please keep NET NEUTRALITY. Thank You. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."
"Chairman Pai:  Hi, I'd like to comment on net neutrality rules. I would like to encourage the Federal Communications Commission to undo The previous administration's power grab to control the Internet. Internet users, rather than so-called experts, should be empowered to purchase which applications they desire. The previous administration's power grab to control the Internet is a corruption of net neutrality. It stopped a pro-consumer framework that performed exceptionally successfully for two decades with broad bipartisan backing."
"To whom it may concern:  My comments re: internet regulations. I request the commissioners to undo Obama's power grab to control Internet access. Internet users, as opposed to so-called experts, should be free to purchase the products we choose. Obama's power grab to control Internet access is a distortion of net neutrality. It reversed a free-market approach that performed fabulously smoothly for decades with broad bipartisan support."
"The FCC should safeguard Internet freedom by keeping the bright-line net neutrality protections in place and upholding Title II. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping users of the vital access and privacy safeguards we demanded and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because It will stifle small business during startup and unnecessarily hamper consumer choice. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block consumers' ability to see certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging online services and websites more money to reach consumers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai's proposal would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

It is the easiest and most comprehensive database of information that I use for my studies and for my small business.

It reversed a pro-consumer system that performed fabulously well for many years with both parties' backing."
"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won.

That kind of policy clearly benefits the ISPs, and hurts 'regular' people like me.

"FCC:  Hi, I'd like to comment on NET NEUTRALITY. I'd like to urge Chairman Pai to overturn The Obama/Wheeler scheme to control broadband. People like me, as opposed to Washington, should be empowered to select which products they choose. The Obama/Wheeler scheme to control broadband is a perversion of the open Internet. It undid a hands-off framework that functioned very, very well for a long time with broad bipartisan support."

"We need the FCC to defend the rights of millions of Internet users by upholding net neutrality protections. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the meaningful privacy and access rules we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that ISP monopolies can't block or slow users' access to certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services money to reach customers faster. That's the best way forward to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

Countries with dictators like China and Russia do not allow free access, but the United States is BETTER than that. 
Free society's like the United States do not authorize or protect unfair competition by giving some companies the advantage.  We want equal access!   


Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing Title II net neutrality rules."

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster.

The internet is vital for the economy. I work in technology, usually at smaller companies that are just starting up. Fast Lanes will reduce competition, hurt the free market, small businesses, and the jobs they provide. It will make choices less diverse and less interesting, and hurt competition. This is unAmerican.

The internet matters to me because it is a wonderful thing that many people, including me, use. The internet can be used to entertain millions of people, and it can also be used for informative reasons, so people can gain knowledge. But, with net neutrality gone, the internet would be limited and many people would not be able to express themselves fully or gain knowledge. That is why the internet matters to me.

"Dear Mr. Pai,  I'm very worried about the FCC regulations on the Internet. I'd like to implore you to reverse The previous administration's plan to control the Internet. Individual Americans, rather than big government, should be empowered to enjoy which applications they desire. The previous administration's plan to control the Internet is a perversion of the open Internet. It stopped a hands-off system that performed exceptionally well for a long time with Republican and Democrat support."

"FCC:  I'm concerned about Internet regulation and net neutrality. I demand the commission to overturn Obama's scheme to regulate broadband.

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that ISP monopolies can't slow or block consumers' access to certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach people faster.

The internet is, at its heart, information. Information is the greatest asset and the most powerful weapon. Controlling access to information puts the power into the hands of a few corporations. Ending net neutrality would plunge a dawning enlightenment into the dark ages. Please don't let this happen.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the legal cover to throttle whatever they please, stripping users of the vital access and privacy protections we fought for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules ensure that Internet providers can't block or slow customers' access to certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach consumers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

Knowledge shouldn't be restricted based on profit for the rich. 

I appreciate you maintaining Title II net neutrality rules and the rights of Internet users like me."
"Dear Mr. Pai,  My comments re: restoring Internet freedom. I want to advocate the commissioners to rescind Barack Obama's scheme to take over the web.

It ended a hands-off framework that performed exceptionally smoothly for a long time with bipartisan support."

"The FCC must protect the open Internet by maintaining net neutrality protections under Title II. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the telecom giants like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T free rein to throttle whatever they please, stripping users of the necessary privacy and access rules we worked for and so recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules ensure that Internet providers can't block or slow our access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services more money to reach consumers faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 

The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.

Thank you! 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

"The FCC needs to stand up for Internet users like me and keep the net neutrality rules that are already in effect. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to hand the telecom giants like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the necessary privacy and access protections we demanded and won just two years ago. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that ISPs can't slow or block customers' access to certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services more money to reach consumers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai's proposal would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

The internet was life changing and world changing. The beauty of the internet is that all websites are equally available to everyone. Certains sites like Facebook and YouTube have made an impression on society. But imagine if they didn't even have the opportunity to get so big because they were stuck in a slow lane while other less valuable sites were in the fast lane purely because they had the money to pay for it.
The internet has become a community for people to make art together, find love, advertise small and big businesses alike, teach skills, stay informed on the news etc. To take away all that the internet has to offer by letting the big corporarions of the world have the most power is undemocratic. Despite living in a capitalistic society, our country fundamentally believes in freedom. We can never forget that or all is lost in democracy. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules ensure that ISP monopolies can't slow or block Internet users' ability to see certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services money to reach customers faster.

I use the internet on a day to day basis, as do all of my friends, if this goes through I might not have a stable way to contact friends around the world and vice versa. If internet providers put a cost on access to websites the results will be catastrophic for the entire internet.

"I'm calling on the FCC to stand up for net neutrality and safeguard Title II protections. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the telecom giants like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful privacy and access safeguards we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can't slow or block consumers' access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach consumers faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposal would help turn ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

Meeting and connecting with people  are possible for me because the internet is free and open. I  can't imagine how many important connections I would have missed if ISP's had the power to cut groups apart and blockade people from the internet. Please do not let the ISP's limit the internet. 

Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing Title II net neutrality rules."

I use the internet everyday, and I should not have to worry about my ISP charging me more for what websites I go to. The UN has classified Internet service as a basic human right and keeping ISPs regulated under Title II is important.

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it. 
The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.
Please leave the existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.
Thank you!

"Dear Commissioners:  I'm very concerned about regulations on the Internet. I would like to request you to repeal The Obama/Wheeler decision to take over Internet access.

"Dear Commissioners:  I'm concerned about Net Neutrality and Title II. I'd like to ask Ajit Pai to undo Obama's order to regulate the Internet.

"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

"The FCC should safeguard Internet freedom by keeping the bright-line net neutrality protections in place and upholding Title II. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the authority to throttle whatever they please, stripping users of the vital privacy and access rules we fought for and so recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations mean that ISP monopolies can't slow or block customers' ability to see certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 
First, as a woman of color, the internet allows me to gain access to opportunities I otherwise wouldn't have had access to before. Secondly, it allows me to become a person whose more conscious of the world I live in; who not only cares about the issues at home but about the global issues as well. 
The internet is important to me because it brings the power back to me, the individual. On some level, it balances the playing field for the underserved, the underrepresented, the marginalized and taking away something that Vital only further divides society more than it already is.
The internet brings opportunities to people. For example, it helps a struggling individual, whether they be a teacher, student, artist, musician' etc. to achieve their dreams in this ever-expanding world, where the job market continues to change and you don't know if that degree you spent so many Years and Money on is going to open those doors it was supposed to do when you finish. And yet you have a few powerful people there, who already have an advantage in this game to take that power away? Then, what's left? 
The internet matters to me because it allows an environment where people gain access to opportunities they otherwise wouldn't have had access to. I strongly believe that the focus should be on how much this benefits the Majority of the population and not just the powerful few. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the vital privacy and access rules we demanded and so recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules mean that Internet providers can't block or slow users' ability to see certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging online services and websites more money to reach people faster. That's the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation.

The internet is full of information and ways to diversify yourself and explore new things. Don't make this something people can't afford or access. Don't make the internet another place for people going through hard times to have an even tougher time. Let people have their voice. Let people flourish.

I believe the internet is the greatest ubiquitous permeable learning tool ever generated by man and should in no way be run like a telecommunications company. It is the fact that it is neutral to content that makes it so important. It is far better to have the record of the true nature of  human interests at this time than it is to have another record where all behavior is governed by spreadsheet bottomline business. 

The internet was founded by Tim Berners Lee as a repository for educational peer to peer sharing. I fail to see how the dream of the architect can stay in place if content is allowed to be censored through data transmission alteration from private interest groups. If they want to enjoy the spoils of internet ""foot traffic"" they can do it by creating worthwhile content like the rest of us. The internet should be a safe haven for free protected speech and creativity. 

Please keep Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me. It is imperative to do so for small businesses and true creative publishing."

I use to talk to family and friends. I use it to talk to my army recruiter. I use it to keep in touch with the world. My family depends on it for communication from work. I am not willing to support the right to throttle or accelerate Internet speeds based on potential racism, sexism, political beliefs, bribery, or any other kind of bias. The Internet allows all people equal access to work, study, and opportunities required to thrive. Without net neutrality, freelance workers will have to abandon their trades, students will be severely limited to knowledge picked out by people who profit on selective ignorance, and developments on a technological front will likely stagnant due to new, higher rates.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon the legal cover to throttle whatever they please, stripping consumers of the vital privacy and access protections we demanded and so recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that ISPs can't slow or block customers' ability to see certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging online services and websites more money to reach consumers faster. That's the best way forward to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai's proposal would help turn Internet providers into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

It's incredibly important that we continue to have open and fair access to the internet in today's hyperconnected world. It is incredibly concerning that we are hurtling towards a future where businesses/groups can pay off ISPs in an effort to be the only voice I can reasonably hear on the internet.

The internet is a powerful international tool that has lead to the greatest assess to information sharing the world has ever seen.

Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

"The FCC should safeguard Internet freedom by keeping the bright-line net neutrality protections in place and upholding Title II. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the legal cover to throttle whatever they please, stripping users of the necessary access and privacy rules we worked for and so recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block Internet users' access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I use it everyday. I need it to remain free and open. Too many underprivileged individuals NEED to access it for job searches and the like.  Free and open to ALL. 

I appreciate you maintaining Title II net neutrality rules and the rights of Internet users like me."

It stopped a free-market approach that performed very successfully for many years with both parties' support."

"Dear Mr. Pai,  Hi, I'd like to comment on the FCC regulations on the Internet. I want to encourage you to undo Tom Wheeler's plan to take over broadband.

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet.

"To the FCC:  I'm very worried about Title II rules. I would like to demand the Federal Communications Commission to rescind The Obama/Wheeler order to take over the Internet. Americans, not big government, should buy which services we desire. The Obama/Wheeler order to take over the Internet is a betrayal of net neutrality. It stopped a hands-off system that worked supremely smoothly for a long time with both parties' approval."

"The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T free rein to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the vital privacy and access protections we demanded and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can't block or slow Internet users' ability to see certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That's the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 

The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

Please leave the existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.

Thank you! 

I appreciate you maintaining Title II net neutrality rules and the rights of Internet users like me."

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

Sincerely,
Mark E Wheeler"

"Dear FCC,

The FCC must protect the open Internet by maintaining net neutrality protections under Title II. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping users of the vital privacy and access protections we demanded and so recently won. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs will have too much power to determine what I can do online. 

Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules ensure that ISPs can't block or slow users' access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites more money to reach consumers faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform Internet providers into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation.

"The FCC should safeguard Internet freedom by keeping the bright-line net neutrality protections in place and upholding Title II. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to hand the telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the necessary privacy and access protections we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules mean that Internet providers can't block or slow users' access to certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach people faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The Internet is a uniquely important space for free speech because the Internet is the same for every socioeconomic group. Current law protects this equality. The proposed change to this law would allow corporations to charge certain sites for faster loading speeds, among other things. This would mean the swift destruction of the equality and free access to information you currently enjoy. Do not take this for granted. Protect freedom of speech. Protect a form of media that brings people together. Protect the sharing of knowledge across all kinds of barriers. We are lucky enough to literally hold in the palms of our hands the kind of power people used to merely dream about. Right now that power is threatened, and we are the only people who can defend it. Make sure the Internet remains a place every voice is heard. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players.

"The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and access safeguards we worked for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that ISPs can't block or slow users' access to certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach consumers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The internet is an entire database of endless knowledge at our fingertips and it shouldn't be censored for ANYONE regardless of what they can/can't afford or any other reason. You wouldn't censor a library. 

Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing Title II net neutrality rules."

"I am NOT in support of reclassifying broadband Internet access as an information service under Title I. In my opinion it is properly classified as a telecommunication service under Title II.

The FCC should be protecting the consumer not the worrying about dampening ""providers' incentive to invest and innovate"". Providers, will innovate and invest if the consumer demand is there to do it. They will most certainly charge the consumer more if they do. That is their incentive. They do not need the FCC to ""help"" them. The FCC has said that ""reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service has led to significant regulatory burdens"" on providers. These requirements, if they are indeed burdens, are designed to protect people like me who do not want the internet service they receive to be throttled or manipulated in any way by providers that do not have the consumers best interests in mind. You, the FCC, should have the consumer's best interests in mind and not weaken regulations that protect the us. Providers will adjust, jobs will not be lost, and consumers will buy the services they want. The system is not ""broken"" for consumers and you do not have to ""fix"" it.

Thank you for the opportunity to make comments.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression.

The internet is now a sort of neural network, or better a commons, the commons, for how the world communicates with one another. Taking steps that allow for more consolidation of power in this vital infrastructure is shortsighted. For profit telecommunications companies have profit at top of mind, and therefore cannot be given authority to organize the internet how they prefer it to be. The internet is too important to risk a failure of a free market approach.

It broke a market-based framework that worked remarkably successfully for decades with bipartisan consensus."
"The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the authority to engage in data discrimination, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and access rules we demanded and just recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block Internet users' ability to see certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services money to reach people faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai's proposal would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I'm writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.
The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.
Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.
Thank you! 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."
"I'm calling on the FCC to stand up for net neutrality and safeguard Title II protections. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the legal cover to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and won just two years ago. 

I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with 'fast lanes' for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules ensure that Internet providers can't block or slow consumers' ability to see certain web services or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach people faster.

That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I work at a public library and see thousands of people come through our doors on a daily basis to use the Internet to look for a job, to take online classes or exams, and for many other reasons.  The community we serve is primarily low income and we are a resource for them.  I'm calling on the FCC to stand up for net neutrality and safeguard Title II protections.

"Mr Pai:  Regarding the Open Internet order. I would like to implore the FCC to reverse Obama's scheme to control the Internet.

"The FCC should ensure a fair and open Internet for all by opposing efforts to undermine net neutrality. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping consumers of the necessary access and privacy safeguards we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that ISPs can't slow or block Internet users' ability to see certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach consumers faster. That's the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposal would transform Internet providers into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

The internet is what gives those without a voice a voice, and while companies like comcast pretend that they own it. The internet is not something that needs walls and by segregating our internet it will allow countries like China to run circles around us in the global market. PS If this passes so help me God anyone involved including congress will feel the wrath of Republican and Democrat voters like likes you have never seen. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me."
"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the authority to engage in data discrimination, stripping users of the necessary access and privacy safeguards we fought for and so recently won. 

I'm afraid of a 'pay-to-play' Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that ISPs can't block or slow our access to certain websites or create Internet 'fast lanes' by charging websites and online services more money to reach customers faster. That's the right kind of forward-looking approach to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposal would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The internet has done a lot fore me please don't remove net neutrality! 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."
